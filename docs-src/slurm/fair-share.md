# Fair Share

## Description

The provided resources of UBELIX are meant to be provided in a fair faishon between all interested research groups. Therefore, Workspaces belong to research groups. Every participating research group is entitled for the same amount of resources. This entitlement is shared between all Workspace accounts and its members using that accounts. 

The fair-share system is designed to encourage users to balance their use of resources over time and de-prioritize users/accounts with over average usage. 
Thus no user group/research group gets the opportunity to over-dominate on the systems, while others request resources. 
Fair-share is the largest factor in determining priority, but not the only one. 



## Fair Share Score
Your Fair Share score is a number between 0 and 1. Projects with a **larger** Fair Share score receive a **higher priority** in the queue.

If an entity — a research group or its Workspace account — is using the machine more slowly than expected, for Fair Share purposes it is considered a light user. By contrast, one using the machine faster than expected is a heavy user.

- Workspaces at lightly using research groups get a higher Fair Share score than those at heavily using research groups.
- Within each research group, lightly using Workspaces get a higher Fair Share score than heavily using Workspaces.
- Using **faster** than your **expected rate of usage** will usually cause your Fair Share score to **decrease**. The more extreme the overuse, the more severe the likely drop.
- Using **slower** than your **expected rate of usage** will usually cause your Fair Share score to **increase**. The more extreme the underuse, the greater the Fair Share bonus.
- Using the cluster **unevenly** will cause your Fair Share score to **decrease**.

## Priorities
The Fair Share score is used to set the job priorities. It is based on a share of the cluster, which is a fraction of the cluster's overall computing capacity.
