# HPC Glossary: Important Terms to Know {#glossary}

## Units of Measurement 
1TB (Terabyte) = 1,000GB (Gigabyte)  
1GB (Gigabyte) = 1,000MB (Megabyte)  


## Terms 

**Cluster**
: An HPC cluster is a high-performance, parallel computing infrastructure which consists of three key components: compute, network, and storage. On a cluster one can take advantage of multiple cores by running several instances of a program at once or using a parallelized version of the program.

**Batch Processing**

**New term**

**Core**  
: An alternative term for a central processing unit (CPU), especially used when several are present in a single processor chip.  

**MPI** 
: An abbreviation of Message Passing Interface, a way of running the same job across multiple nodes (or maybe the same node). An MPI job will spawn multiple tasks that exchange control signals and data by “messages”, hence the name.

**Task** 
: A single running instance of a computer program. Each task consists of at least one thread.  

**Thread** 
: A sequence of instructions that can be managed independently by the operating system. Threads are grouped into tasks. Ideally, each thread should have its own core to run on.   

**Environment**
: def

**Node** 
: A single computing device within a cluster. A node is the equivalent of a personal computer or laptop. Every node in a NeSI cluster has many cores.

**Compute node:**
