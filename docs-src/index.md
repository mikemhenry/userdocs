## Acknowledging Lilac
When you present results generated using our clusters, we kindly ask you
to acknowledge the usage of the cluster. We would also highly appreciate if you
could send us a copy of your papers, posters and presentations mentioning the
cluster. Public visibility of our cluster and documenting results are
important for us to ensure long-term funding of the clusters

Whenever the Lilac infrastructure has been used to produce results used in a
publication or poster, we kindly request citing the service in the
acknowledgements:

    "Calculations were performed on Lilac, the HPC cluster at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center."

### Press Kit
Occasionally we are asked for images like diagrams illustrating the structure of Lilac or even pictures of machines/storage or the like. Often this is due to the need to describe Lilac within a research proposal. To support you with this, we provide a short text about Lilac and some files to download. You can use all of this within your research proposal.
