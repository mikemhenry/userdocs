# Welcome to the High Performance Computing (HPC) documentation of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

## Introduction

Official documentation site of the high performance computing and the HPC
cluster Lilac.

The Lilac cluster runs about 330 compute nodes featuring almost
6'300 CPU cores and about 300'000 GPU cores. The infrastructure is available
to all faculties for their scientific work. The cluster can also be
used by students within a scope of a thesis or a course.

If your MSK account is not yet activated for Lilac, the [Getting Started Guide](quick-start.md)
might be a good place to get you started.

Lilac features a plethora of software and applications, which is outlined on
the page Software, but the users are free to compile and install their own
software within their home directories.

!!! note "Job Monitoring"
    See what is currently running on the clusters on [Grafana](https://hpc-grafana.mskcc.org/d/000000005/cluster-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=10s).

## Acknowledging Lilac

When you present results generated using our clusters, we kindly ask you
to acknowledge the usage of the cluster. We would also highly appreciate if you
could send us a copy of your papers, posters and presentations mentioning the
cluster. Public visibility of our cluster and documenting results are
important for us to ensure long-term funding of the clusters

Whenever the Lilac infrastructure has been used to produce results used in a
publication or poster, we kindly request citing the service in the
acknowledgements:

    "Calculations were performed on Lilac, the HPC cluster at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center."

## Press Kit
Occasionally we are asked for images like diagrams illustrating the structure of Lilac or even pictures of machines/storage or the like. Often this is due to the need to describe Lilac within a research proposal. To support you with this, we provide a short text about Lilac and some files to download. You can use all of this within your research proposal.
